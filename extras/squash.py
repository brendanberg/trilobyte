		A single character in the range 0 - 127 (ASCII) is encoded as itself.

		high-order bits are prefixed with the codeword '1110' and the low-
		order bits are prefixed with the codeword '1100'.

		Therefore, the byte '10110111' would be encoded as '11101011 11000111'
		
		Runs of two through 65 characters are encoded as above, with a prefix
		byte that identifies the length of the run. A run length byte itself
		is prefixed with the codeword '10'. Since runs of length zero or one
		are not possible, we subtract 2 from the run length before encoding
		the byte.
